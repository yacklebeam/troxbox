<h1>MOTION_TOOLKIT</h1>

Motion in video games can be the difference between a bad and an amazing user experience.  If our motion relies only on positional information, then we lose that information (velocity, acceleration) which contribute to motion in the physical world.  Thus, we want to use information about an entity's position, velocity, and acceleration to determine their movement in the world.

This project examines the user experience differences between simple motion and complex motion in a game environment.

<h2>Controls:</h2>

"WASD" to Move.
"U" to toggle motion type (your player color changes to reflect current mode).  Green is simple (no velocity or acceleration), Red is complex.
