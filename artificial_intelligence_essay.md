	When questioning artificial intelligence, we are first presented with a much more important question.  What is intelligence, and how does that definition affect what it means for a program to be intelligent?  The classical definition of intelligence looks to the human race as "intelligence", and it is from there that the comparison is made.  However, I believe that intelligence, while manifested in humanity, is no solely constrained to them.  Thus, when discussing intelligent machines, we must arrive at some notion of intelligence which is not simply humanity.  To that end, it does not suffice to say that an intelligent program is one which emulates humanity or one which can successfully "act human", but rather we must discuss intelligent programs as quite specifically **those programs which are intelligent**.
	Intelligence then is where we must begin.  When we say that something, whether that something is human or beast or machine is intelligent, what we surely mean is that this "something" possesses certain characteristics and can perform certain tasks which we prescribe as intelligent.  This of course should come as no surprise.  However, I must be very explicit about one fact -- I disagree with any notions that intelligence is inherently human.  Thus, any machine acts intelligently should be considered intelligent, whether or not that machine can successfully pass as human.  That being said, it surely follows that any machine that can act human (by say, passing some version of a Turing-like Test), can certainly be considered intelligent, since we do consider ourselves to be intelligent.  But again, I must stress the distinction that is a the center of my beliefs about artificial intelligence -- the machines I just described are intelligent **not because they are sufficiently human-like** but rather their intelligence allows them to be so.
	So what then, does it mean to be intelligent?  When we look at a human child, even one in its infancy, we can say with certainty that they are intelligent.  There must be some definable characteristics or abilities which allow us to assert this!  Some of these are easy to identify (but usually hard to define): the ability to reason and make sense of the world (used loosely) around us, an inherent recognition of self, the ability to make decisions when presented with new situations (generally using some aggregate of previously gather information), the ability to learn and remember, and the ability to recall and store information in various ways (for a human, this can mean translating data from the senses into abstract concepts).  However, many such characteristics are harder to prescribe to intelligence, like the ability to decipher right and wrong, or a drive for self-preservation.  The problem of course is that no system can argue for it's own consistency (or inconsistency) from within, a problem recognized quickly by mathematicians.  Thus, we must **decide** on those characteristics we believe to be intelligent, and only then can we discuss what that means for programs -- keeping in mind that our view of intelligence will always be tinted (or perhaps tainted) by our human-ness.
